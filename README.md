Solar System is a small webpage containing some basic information about the
Solar System and each of its planets.

It comprises of 9 html files (one index.html file about The Solar System  as a whole and
eight files for each of its planets), plus 1 scss file. There needs to be a Sass
compiler in order to render it. It is possible to navigate from one page to any
other using either a navbar or links provided within the page. Possible to
render with any browser that supports html5. Also, it is mobile responsive
as it takes advantage of bootstrap grid system.
All the information that the webpage contains were sourced from Wikipedia and
