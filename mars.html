          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System
          after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred
          to as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent
          on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical
          bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere,
          having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys,
          deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

          The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period
          as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar.
          Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet
          in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
          The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant
          impact feature.

          Mars has been explored by numerous unmanned spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by NASA on November 28,
           1964, was the first spacecraft to visit Mars, making its closest approach to the planet on July 15,
            1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earthâ€™s,
            and captured the first images of another planet from deep space. On July 20, 1976, Viking 1 performed
            the first successful landing on the Martian surface.

          There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of Mars, as well as the
          possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned, including the Perseverance and
           Rosalind Franklin rovers.Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric
           pressure, which is less than 1% of the Earth's, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.
           The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.
