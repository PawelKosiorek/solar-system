          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
          According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
          Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which
          is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days,
          a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times.

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">
          Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
          The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation
          on its axis,
          and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest
          and most massive of the four rocky planets.

          Earth's outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that
          migrate across the surface over many millions of years.
          About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands.
          The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water,
          which all together constitute the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice,
          including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack.

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">
          Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface,
          leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms.
          Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago.
          Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological
          history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has
           gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of
           all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct.
