          Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).
          It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†,
          a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

          Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar
          System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.
          Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its
          orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. The position
           of Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard's observations, independently,
            by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his death. Neptune was subsequently
            observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree
            of the position predicted by Le Verrier.

          Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen
          and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it
          contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane.
          However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;
          Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction.
          Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">
          In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus,
          Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example,
          at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere
          had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather
          patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar
          System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).
          Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of
          the coldest places in the Solar System.
