          Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
          It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half
          times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one
          of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known
          to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god
          Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light
          to cast shadows.

          Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium,
          though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also
          have a rocky core of heavier elements,but like the other giant planets, Jupiter
          lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape
          is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).
          The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes,
          resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.

          Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to
          the planet on December 4, 1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field
           and also found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million kilometers long,
           covering the entire distance to Saturn.Jupiter has been explored on a number of
           occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions
           from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995.
           In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe.

          Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System. It has a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. The average density of Jupiter, 1.326 g/cm3, is the second highest of the giant planets, but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.
