          Uranus (from the Latin name Ūranus for the Greek god Οὐρανός) is the seventh planet from the Sun.
          It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
          Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ
          from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
          Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus' atmosphere is
          similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium.

          Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons.
          The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways,
          nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most
          other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an
          almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with
          the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet.

          Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised
          as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.Sir William Herschel
          first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the
          known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first
          planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope.

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">
          Uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was
          generally mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos,
          who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated
          into Ptolemy's Almagest. The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed
          observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles
          Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.
