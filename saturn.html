          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
          It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.
          It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume,
          Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

          Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of ironâ€“nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
          This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen
          and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer.
          Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.
          An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary
          magnetic field.

          The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles,
          with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit Saturn,
          of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings.
          Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury,
          although less massive.

          Saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium.
          It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core.
          Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km.
