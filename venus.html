          Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
          As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and,
          rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.Venus lies within Earth's orbit,
          and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after
          dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn.
          Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.

          Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size,
          mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.
          It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.
          The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F),
          even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.

          As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture
          for as long as records have existed.
          It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
           writers and poets as the morning star and evening star.
          Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.

        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">
          As the planet with the closest approach to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for
           early interplanetary exploration.
          It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and
          the first to be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970).
          Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light,
           and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991.
