          Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.
          Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System.
          It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">
          Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent
          distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
          This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after
          sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
          At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult
          to observe than Venus.

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">
          Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked
          with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,meaning that relative to the fixed stars,
          it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes
          around the Sun.As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates
          with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years.
          An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-3">
          Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 degree).
          Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion,
          Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion.
          Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's,
          indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.
          Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more
          than on any other planet in the Solar System.
